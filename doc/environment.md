## Introduction

The following environment variables configure the addresses of the databases, some credentials, some application behaviours and the localization preferences. 
If you are in a development environment, your can keep most of the default values, otherwise, in production, values must be configured carefully.

The settings in [config/application.yml](../config/application.yml.default) configure the environment variables when the application run in development mode.
If you run the application in production with docker, the settings are localized in [config/env](../docker/env.example).

<a name="general-settings"></a>
## General settings
<a name="POSTGRES_HOST"></a>

    POSTGRES_HOST

DNS name or IP address of the server hosting the PostgreSQL database of the application (see [PostgreSQL](../README.md#postgresql)).
This value is only used when deploying in production, otherwise this is configured in [config/database.yml](../config/database.yml.default).
When using docker-compose, you should provide the name of the service in your [docker-compose.yml](../docker/docker-compose.yml) file (`postgres` by default).
<a name="POSTGRES_PASSWORD"></a>

    POSTGRES_PASSWORD

Password for the PostgreSQL user, as specified in `database.yml` (default: `postgres`).
Please see [Setup the FabManager database in PostgreSQL](../README.md#setup-fabmanager-in-postgresql) for information on how to create a user and set his password.
This value is only used when deploying in production, otherwise this is configured in [config/database.yml](../config/database.yml.default).
When using docker-compose, the default configuration (with `postgres` user) does not uses any password as it is confined in the docker container.
<a name="REDIS_HOST"></a>

    REDIS_HOST

DNS name or IP address of the server hosting the redis database.
When using docker-compose, you should provide the name of the service in your [docker-compose.yml](../docker/docker-compose.yml) file (`redis` by default).
<a name="ELASTICSEARCH_HOST"></a>

    ELASTICSEARCH_HOST

DNS name or IP address of the server hosting the elasticSearch database.
When using docker-compose, you should provide the name of the service in your [docker-compose.yml](../docker/docker-compose.yml) file (`elasticsearch` by default).
<a name="SECRET_KEY_BASE"></a>

    SECRET_KEY_BASE

Used by the authentication system to generate random tokens, eg. for resetting passwords.
Used by Rails to verify the integrity of signed cookies.
You can generate such a random key by running `rake secret`.
<a name="STRIPE_API_KEY"></a><a name="STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"></a>

    STRIPE_API_KEY & STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

Key and secret used to identify you Stripe account through the API.
Retrieve them from https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys.

**MANDATORY**: Even if you don't want to charge your customers, you must fill this settings. 
For this purpose, you can use a stripe account in test mode, which will provide you test keys.
<a name="STRIPE_CURRENCY"></a>

    STRIPE_CURRENCY

Currency used by stripe to charge the final customer.
See https://support.stripe.com/questions/which-currencies-does-stripe-support for a list of available 3-letters ISO code.

**BEWARE**: stripe currency cannot be changed during the application life.
Changing the currency after the application has already run, may result in several bugs and prevent the users to pay through stripe.
So set this setting carefully before starting the application for the first time.
<a name="INVOICE_PREFIX"></a>

    INVOICE_PREFIX

When payments are done on the platform, an invoice will be generated as a PDF file.
The PDF file name will be of the form "(INVOICE_PREFIX) - (invoice ID) _ (invoice date) .pdf".
<a name="FABLAB_WITHOUT_PLANS"></a>

    FABLAB_WITHOUT_PLANS

If set to 'true', the subscription plans will be fully disabled and invisible in the application.
It is not recommended to disable plans if at least one subscription was took on the platform.
<a name="FABLAB_WITHOUT_SPACES"></a>

    FABLAB_WITHOUT_SPACES

If set to 'false', enable the spaces management and reservation in the application.
It is not recommended to disable spaces if at least one space reservation was made on the system.
<a name="FABLAB_WITHOUT_ONLINE_PAYMENT"></a>

    FABLAB_WITHOUT_ONLINE_PAYMENT

If set to 'true', the online payment won't be available and the you'll be only able to process reservations when logged as admin.
Valid stripe API keys are still required, even if you don't require online payments.
<a name="FABLAB_WITHOUT_INVOICES"></a>

    FABLAB_WITHOUT_INVOICES

If set to 'true', the invoices will be disabled. 
This is useful if you have your own invoicing system and you want to prevent Fab-manager from generating and sending invoices to members.
**Very important**: if you disable invoices, you still have to configure VAT in the interface to prevent errors in accounting and prices.
<a name="DEFAULT_MAIL_FROM"></a>
