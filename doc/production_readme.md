# Install Fab-manager in production with docker-compose

This document will guide you through all the steps needed to set up your Fab-manager app on a production server, based on a solution using Docker and Docker-compose.
We recommend DigitalOcean, but these steps will work on any Docker-compatible cloud provider or local server.

In order to make it work, please use the same directories structure as described in this guide in your Fab-manager app folder.
You will need to be root through the rest of the setup.

## Preliminary steps

<a name="setup-the-server"></a>
### Setup the server

There are many hosting providers on the internet, providing affordable virtual private serveurs (VPS).
Here's a non exhaustive list:
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/#droplet)
- [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/fr/vps/) 
- [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/ec2/)
- [Gandi](https://v4.gandi.net/hebergement/serveur/prix)
- [Ikoula](https://express.ikoula.com/fr/serveur-virtuel)
- [1&1](https://www.1and1.fr/serveurs-virtuels)
- [GoDaddy](https://fr.godaddy.com/hosting/vps-hosting)
- [and many others...](https://www.google.fr/search?q=vps+hosting)

Choose one, depending on your budget, on the server's location, on the uptime guarantee, etc.

You will need at least 2GB of addressable memory (RAM + swap) to install and use Fab-manager.
We recommend 4 GB RAM for larger communities.

On DigitalOcean, create a Droplet with One-click apps **"Docker on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS"**.
This way, Docker and Docker-compose are pre-installed.
Choose a datacenter and set your domain name as the hostname.

With other providers, choose a [supported operating system](../README.md#software-stack) and install docker on it:
- Install [Docker on Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
- Install [Docker on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

Then install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

<a name="setup-the-domain-name"></a>
### Setup the domain name

There are many domain name registrars on the internet, you may choose one that fit your needs.
You can find an exhaustive list [on the ICANN website](https://www.icann.org/registrar-reports/accredited-list.html)

1. Once done, buy a domain name on it
2. Replace the IP address of the domain with the IP address of your VPS (This is a DNS record type A)
3. **Do not** try to access your domain name right away, DNS are not aware of the change yet so **WAIT** and be patient.

<a name="connect-through-ssh"></a>
### Connect through SSH

You can already connect to the server with this command: `ssh root@server-ip`. When DNS propagation will be done, you will be able to
connect to the server with `ssh root@your-domain-name`.

<a name="prepare-the-server"></a>
### Prepare the server

Before installing Fab-manager, we recommend you to:
- Upgrade your system
- Setup the server timezone
- Add at least 2GB of swap memory
- Protect your SSH connection by forcing it through a RSA key

You can run the following script as root to easily perform all these operations:

```bash
\curl -sSL prepare-vps.sleede.com | bash
```

<a name="install-fab-manager"></a>
## Install Fab-manager

Run the following command to install Fab-manager.
This script will guide you through the installation process by checking the requirements and asking you the configuration elements.

```bash
\curl -sSL setup.fab-manager.com | bash
```

**OR**, if you don't want to install Fab-manager in `/apps/fabmanager`, use the following instead:
```bash
\curl -sSL setup.fab-manager.com | bash -s "/my/custom/path"
```

## Fab-manager for small configurations

If your server machine is not powerful, you can lower the system requirements by uninstalling ElasticSearch.
In order to remove ElasticSearch, you must **first** disable the statistics module from Customization > General > Modules.

Then, you can remove the `elasticsearch` service from the [docker-compose.yml](../setup/docker-compose.yml) file and restart the whole application:
```bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

Disabling ElasticSearch will save up to 800 Mb of memory. 

<a name="docker-utils"></a>
## Docker utils
Below, you'll find a collection of useful commands to control your instance with docker-compose.
Before using any of these commands, you must first `cd` into the app directory.

- Read again the environment variables and restart
```bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```
- Open a bash prompt in the app context
```bash
docker-compose exec fabmanager bash
```
- Show services status
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
- Example of command passing env variables
```bash
docker-compose run --rm -e VAR1=xxx -e VAR2=xxx fabmanager bundle exec rails my:command
```
<a name="update-fabmanager"></a>

## Easy upgrade

Starting with Fab-manager v4.5.0, you can upgrade Fab-manager in one single easy command, that automates the procedure below.
To upgrade with ease, using this command, read the GitHub release notes of all versions between your current version and the target version.

**You MUST append all the arguments** of the easy upgrade commands, for **each version**, to the command you run.

Eg.
If you upgrade from 1.2.3 to 1.2.5, with the following release notes:
```markdown
## 1.2.4
\curl -sSL upgrade.fab-manager.com | bash -s -- -e "VAR=value"
## 1.2.5
\curl -sSL upgrade.fab-manager.com | bash -s -- -c "rails fablab:setup:command"
```
Then, you'll need to perform the upgrade with the following command:
```bash
\curl -sSL upgrade.fab-manager.com | bash -s -- -e "VAR=value" -c "rails fablab:setup:command"
```

## Update Fab-manager

*This procedure updates Fab-manager to the most recent version by default.*

> ⚠ If you are upgrading from a very outdated version, you must first upgrade to v2.8.3, then to v3.1.2, then to 4.0.4, then to 4.4.6 and finally to the last version

> ⚠ With versions < 4.3.3, you must replace `bundle exec rails` with `bundle exec rake` in all the commands above

### Steps

When a new version is available, follow this procedure to update Fab-manager app in a production environment, using docker-compose.
You can subscribe to [this atom feed](https://github.com/sleede/fab-manager/releases.atom) to get notified when a new release comes out.

1. go to your app folder

   `cd /apps/fabmanager`

2. pull last docker images 

   `docker-compose pull`

3. stop the app

   `docker-compose stop fabmanager`

4. remove old assets

   `rm -Rf public/assets/`

5. compile new assets

   `docker-compose run --rm fabmanager bundle exec rails assets:precompile`

6. run specific commands

   **Do not forget** to check if there are commands to run for your upgrade. Those commands 
   are always specified in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sleede/fab-manager/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and prefixed by **[TODO DEPLOY]**. 
   They are also present in the [releases page](https://github.com/sleede/fab-manager/releases).
 
   Those commands execute specific tasks and have to be run by hand.
   Using docker, you must prefix the commands starting by `rails...` or `rake...` with: `docker-compose run --rm fabmanager bundle exec`.
   In any other cases, the other commands (like those invoking curl `\curl -sSL... | bash`) must not be prefixed.
   You can also ignore commands only applicable to development environnement, which are prefixed by `(dev)` in the CHANGELOG.

7. restart all containers

   ```bash
     docker-compose down
     docker-compose up -d
   ```

You can check that all containers are running with `docker ps`.

<a name="upgrade-to-the-last-version"></a>
### Upgrade to the last version

It's the default behaviour as `docker-compose pull` command will fetch the latest versions of the docker images. 
Be sure to run all the specific commands listed in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sleede/fab-manager/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) between your actual
and the new version in sequential order. (Example: to update from 2.4.0 to 2.4.3, you will run the specific commands for the 2.4.1, then for the 2.4.2 and then for the 2.4.3).

<a name="upgrade-to-a-specific-version"></a>
### Upgrade to a specific version

Edit your [/apps/fabmanager/docker-compose.yml](../setup/docker-compose.yml#L4) file and change the following line:
```yaml
image: sleede/fab-manager
```
For example, here we want to use the v3.1.2:
```yaml
image: sleede/fab-manager:release-v3.1.2
```
Then run the normal upgrade procedure.
