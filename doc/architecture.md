# Architecture

Fab-manager was built on top of Ruby on Rails. Ruby on rails provides a REST API used by a single-page web application.
Historically, the front-end was using Angular.js but as this framework won't be supported anymore in a near future, we're progressively moving to React.

## Software dependencies
- Ruby 2.6

## Backend application

The backend application respects the Ruby-on-Rails conventions for MVC applications.
It mainly provides a REST-JSON API for the frontend application.
It also provides another REST-JSON API, open to the 3rd-party applications, and known as OpenAPI.

## Frontend application

The frontend application is historically an Angular.js MVC application.
We are moving, step-by-step, to an application based on React.js + Typescript.
For now, the main application is still using Angular.js but it uses some React.js components thanks to coatue-oss/react2angular.
