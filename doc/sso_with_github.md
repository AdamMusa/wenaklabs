# How to configure Fab-manager to use a Single Sign-On authentication?

For this guide, we will use [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/) as an example authentication provider, because it uses OAuth 2.0 which is currently implemented in fab-manager, it has a standard implementation of the protocol and it is free to use for everyone.

- First, you must have a GitHub account. This is free, so create one if you don't have any.
  Visit https://github.com/join?source=login to create an account.

- Secondly, you will need to register your fab-manager instance as an application in GitHub.
  Visit https://github.com/settings/applications/new to register your instance.
  - In `Application name`, we advise you to set the same name as your fab-manager's instance title.
  - In `Homepage URL`, put the public URL where your fab-manager's instance is located (eg. https://example.com).
  - In `Authorization callback URL`, you must specify an URL that will match this scheme: https://example.com/users/auth/oauth2-github/callback
    - **example.com** is your own fab-manager's address
    - **oauth2-github** match the provider's "strategy name" in the fab-manager.
      It is composed of: **SSO's protocol**, _dash_, **slug of the provider's name**.
      If you have a doubt about what it will be, set any value, create the authentication provider in your fab-manager (see below), then the strategy's name will be shown in the providers list. 
      Afterwards, edit your app on GitHub to set the correct name. 

- You'll be redirected to a page displaying two important information: your **Client ID** and your **Client Secret**.

- Now go to your fab-manager's instance, login as an administrator, go to `Users management` and `Authentication`.
  Click `Add a new authentication provider`, and select _OAuth 2.0_ in the `Authentication type` drop-down list.
  In `name`, you can set whatever you want, but you must be aware that:
  1. You will need to type this name in a terminal to activate the provider, so prefer avoiding chars that must be escaped.
  2. This name will be occasionally displayed to end users, so prefer sweet and speaking names.
  3. The slug of this name is used in the callback URL provided to the SSO server (eg. /users/auth/oauth2-**github**/callback)

- Fulfill the form with the following parameters:
  - **Common URL**: `https://github.com/login/oauth/` This is the common part in the URLs of the two following parameters.
  - **Authorization endpoint**: `authorize` This URL can be found [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/).
  - **Token Acquisition Endpoint**: `access_token` This URL can be found [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/).
  - **Profile edition URL**: `https://github.com/settings/profile` This is the URL where you are directed when you click on `Edit profile` in your GitHub dashboard.
  - **Client identifier**: Your Client ID, collected just before.
  - **Client secret**: Your Client Secret, collected just before.

- Then you will need to define the matching of the fields between the fab-manager and what the external SSO can provide.
  Please note that the only mandatory field is `User.uid`.
  To continue with our GitHub example, you will need to look at [this documentation page](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-the-authenticated-user) to know witch field can be mapped and how, and [this one](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to know the root URL of the API.
  - **Model**: `User`
  - **Field**: `uid`
  - **API endpoint URL**: `https://api.github.com/user` Here you can set a complete URL **OR** only an endpoint referring to the previously set **Common URL**.
  - **API type**: `JSON` Only JSON API are currently supported
  - **API fields**: `id` According to the GitHub API documentation, this is the name of the JSON field which uniquely identify the user.

  Once you have completed and validated the mapping's line, an information button will be available.
  A click on it will show you the type of data expected from the API and, in some cases, you'll be able to configure a transformation.
  For example, the `Profile.gender` field require a boolean attribute but your API may return strings like `man / woman`.
  In this case, you'll be able to configure a transformation for `man` <-> `true` and `woman` <-> `false`.

  Now, you are free to map more fields, like `Profile.github` to `html_url`, or `Profile.avatar` to `avatar_url`...

- Once you are done, your newly created authentication provider, will be marked as **Pending** in the authentication providers list.
  To set it as the current active provider, you must open a terminal on the hosting server (and/or container) and run the following commands:

```bash
# replace GitHub with the name of the provider you just created
rake fablab:auth:switch_provider[GitHub]
```

- As the command just prompted you, you have to re-compile the assets
  - In development, `rake tmp:clear` will do the job.
  - In production with Docker, `rm -rf public/assets`, followed by `docker-compose run --rm fabmanager bundle exec rake assets:precompile`
- Then restart the web-server or the container.
- Finally, to notify all existing users about the change (and send them their migration code/link), run:
```bash
rake fablab:auth:notify_changed
```
